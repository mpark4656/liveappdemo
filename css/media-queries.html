        Main mechanism to make responsive websites - most common attributes are max-width and min-width.
        These are the widths of a viewpoint. A viewpoint represents a polygonal area in computer graphics that is
        currently being viewed. In web browser terms, it refers to the part of the document you're viewing which is
        currently visible in its window.

        The below 3 boxes are originally placed in a row if the viewport is large enough (at least 500px to be exact).
        However, if the viewport shrinks, they will be placed in a column. Also, when using a mobile device, the text
        color inside the boxes is black when in the portrait mode, but red when in the landscape mode.
