    <h1>How CSS "Cascades"</h1>
    <p>
        The order matters in CSS! If there are two pieces of CSS codes that select the same element and apply
        different values for the same attribute, the latter will be applied and the former will be overridden.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, this button below is applied a green color first and then red. Obviously, the red wins because
        it was applied after the green.
    </p>
    <button>This button should be red!</button>
    <p>
        The same rules are applied on CSS files that are referenced via the link element.
        If there is a conflict, the attributes from the last added CSS files are applied
    </p>
