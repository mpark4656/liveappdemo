    <h1>Numbers in Javascript</h1>
    <p>
        Javascript has only one number type - no distinction between integers and decimals, for example.
        Javascript has basic math operations and the tokens representing the basic arithmetic operations are
        very similar to the ones found in other programming languages.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Addition: +</li>
        <li>Subtraction: -</li>
        <li>Multiplication: *</li>
        <li>Division: /</li>
        <li>Modulo: %</li>
        <li>Raise to Power: **</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The order of operations is enforced</p>
    <code><pre>
        // The answer of the below operations is not 37. It's 27.
        // 2 + (4 * 6) + 1
        console.log(2 + 4 * 6 + 1);
    </pre></code>
    <p>
        How do you know if a number is even or odd? Use modulo with 2.
        If the remainder is 1, the number is odd. If the remainder is 0, the number is even.
    </p>
    <code><pre>
        // The answer of the below operations is not 37. It's 27.
        // 2 + (4 * 6) + 1
        if(6 % 2 === 0) console.log('6 is even.');
        if(5 % 2 === 1) console.log('5 is odd.');
    </pre></code>
    <p>You can raise a number to power using **.</p>
    <code><pre>
        console.log('2 to the 6th power is ' + 2 ** 6);
    </pre></code>
    <p>NaN: It stands for Not a Number. For example, 0 / 0 would result in NaN. NaN is considered a number type.</p>
    <code><pre>
        console.log('0 divided by 0 is ' + 0 / 0);
    </pre></code>
    <p>Infinity: 1 / 0 would result in infinity. Infinity is also considered a number type.</p>
    <code><pre>
        console.log('1 divided by 0 is ' + 1 / 0);
    </pre></code>
